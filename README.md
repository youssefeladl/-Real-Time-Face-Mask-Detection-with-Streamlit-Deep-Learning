This project is an **end-to-end Face Mask Detection system** developed with **Deep Learning** and deployed as an **interactive Streamlit web app**.  
Unlike many projects that use pretrained models, this solution features a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built and trained from scratch** for binary image classification:  
- ✅ With Mask  
- ❌ Without Mask

## ✨ Highlights
- 🧠 **Custom CNN**: Trained from scratch, not based on pretrained models.
- 📊 **Notebook Included**: Jupyter notebook with training, validation, and performance visualization.
- 📸 **Real-Time Detection**: Upload an image or capture live through the camera.
- 🎨 **User-Friendly UI**: Built with Streamlit, styled for clarity and simplicity.
- ⚡ **Fast Inference**: Lightweight deployment with TensorFlow & OpenCV.
- 🚀 **Practical Deployment**: Demonstrates how Computer Vision models can be deployed as easy-to-use apps.
